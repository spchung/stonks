## Install Poetry Prerequisites

Before installing Poetry, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your macOS system:

1. **Python**: Poetry requires Python 3.6 or higher. You can check if Python is installed by running `python3 --version` in your terminal. If Python is not installed, you can download and install it from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install Poetry on macOS:

1. **Open Terminal**: Open the Terminal application on your macOS system. You can do this by searching for "Terminal" in Spotlight or navigating to `Applications > Utilities > Terminal`.

2. **Install Poetry**: Use the following command to install Poetry using `curl`:

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

   This command downloads the Poetry installer script and executes it with Python 3, installing Poetry on your system.

3. **Verify Installation**: After the installation is complete, you can verify that Poetry is installed correctly by running:

   ```bash
   poetry --version
   ```

   This command should display the installed version of Poetry.

## Usage

Once Poetry is installed, you can start using it to manage your Python projects. Here are a few basic commands to get started:

- **Creating a New Project**: Use `poetry new project_name` to create a new Python project with Poetry.

- **Adding Dependencies**: Use `poetry add package_name` to add a dependency to your project. Poetry will automatically update your `pyproject.toml` file and install the dependency in your virtual environment.

- **Installing Dependencies**: Use `poetry install` to install dependencies listed in your `pyproject.toml` file.

- **Running Scripts**: Use `poetry run script_name` to run a script defined in your `pyproject.toml` file.

- **Building Packages**: Use `poetry build` to build your project into a distributable package.
